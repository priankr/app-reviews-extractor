The ONE thing I did value and use was the receipt capture- which stopped working months ago with an update. Another business professional has the same issue. It's almost November and they still dont have it corrected. This isn't an app for entertainment; it's used to run a business, and for that, its completely useless.","Google Play Store"

I'm switching to Xero at the end of the year. Edit - I'm not having app issues, the entire app is an issue as Intuit is turning this whole app/program into a sales tool for them to sell small business owners more stuff/fintech services that they don't need.","Google Play Store"

"2025-10-22","1","A. J.","UPDATE - October 2025. My opinion and initial review are unchanged! Amongst other shortcomings, it's not possible to send an invoice reminder. Absolutely awful and good for nothing other than mileage tracking... Even that has bugs and receipt snapping. They keep adding and removing features rather than making the basics functional. Would NEVER risk sending an invoice or receiving a payment.... Simply too unreliable, clunky and basically unusable.","Google Play Store"
"2025-10-22","1","B. R.","The app itself functions pretty well in the short time I was allowed to use it. I started a new business last week and decided I wanted a professional accounting and invoicing software. I downloaded and subscribed to Quickbooks Solopreneur. I also signed up for their checking acct. Today I received my first order and was generating the invoice when I received an email stating my QB bank account was suspended. No explanation is allowed to be given. My ability to accept payments was denied too","Google Play Store"
"2025-10-22","1","F.","Title: QuickBooks: A Masterclass in Customer Neglect If you're considering QuickBooks, do yourself a favor and run in the opposite direction. The software might promise streamlined accounting, but the real cost is your time, sanity, and patience ‚Äî especially when you need help. Customer Support? More Like Customer Abandonment. Trying to get assistance from QuickBooks is like shouting into the void.  While experiencing a problem with customer credit cards one support agent literally told me ""oh it's normal for a new company to have credit cards declined"".  Meanwhile my business is over a decade old! Their support channels are a maze of automated responses, endless hold times, and agents who seem more confused than the users. I‚Äôve spent hours ‚Äî yes, hours ‚Äî waiting for someone to pick up, only to be transferred, disconnected, or given canned answers that solve nothing. Live Chat Is a Joke. The chat feature is a glorified FAQ bot. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to reach a human, expect vague responses, minimal effort, and a quick push to ‚Äúcheck the help articles‚Äù ‚Äî which are often outdated or irrelevant. Phone Support Is a Black Hole. Calling in is a gamble. You might get someone who reads from a script, or worse, someone who clearly doesn‚Äôt understand the product. I‚Äôve had reps contradict each other, give incorrect advice, and even hang up mid-call. No Accountability, No Resolution. Issues linger for weeks. Tickets vanish into thin air. Promised follow-ups never happen. It‚Äôs clear that QuickBooks prioritizes upselling over actual support. Once they have your money, you‚Äôre on your own. Bottom Line: QuickBooks might work fine ‚Äî until it doesn‚Äôt. And when it doesn‚Äôt, you‚Äôll discover just how little they care. If customer support matters to you (and it should), look elsewhere. This is not a company that stands behind its product.","Trustpilot"

In April 2024 they released a new user interface and it‚Äôs absolutely trash. The usability is nonexistent. I‚Äôm going back to using my desktop version because they added so much in efficiency to just creating an invoice or updating an invoice that performing my daily billings is something I dread doing.

Most issues are now sorted but I was told by the very helpful staff, 'I can escalate this if you wish, but really the calculation of taxes won't be affected.' I did agree but still very annoying.

I've been asking for compensation/refund on my payments for a service I haven't received to cover the fine and these have gone ignored. In the early stages I was even asked what my expenses should be, as they were showing different on the tax return vs in QB. THAT'S WHAT I SIGNED UP AND PAY FOR! So I don't have to keep track as QB is supposed to do it for me. It's been ""being escalated to their engineers"" for 6 months now and I've heard very little from them.

First of all every time the app loads it takes a couple of minutes for it to load instead of just giving you the option to upload a receipt, you don‚Äôt need access to your whole database to upload a receipt. Before it more or less opened and you could upload a receipt and then if it needed to upload more data, it was doing it while you were capturing your receipts. Second, Now, when you‚Äôre trying to save the receipts you apparently can‚Äôt close the screen to go do something else while it‚Äôs saving it like it was before.

If you want something that is difficult, non-intuitive, will consume weeks of your time, with dreadful help functionality and nonexistent customer support, QBO is for you. Two simple problems today, neither of which could be resolved. Firstly, i edited the description on an invoice that had already been paid. That change seemed to result in the revenue disappearing so i thought i would undo the change. There is no obvious way of undoing a change, so I went to help and used ""assistant"". All the assistant could do was tell me I hadn't signed up for payroll. I then tried ""search"" (in help) and it gave completely irrelevant information.

Never, ever sign up with your card to their services.  Once your card is on their platform, you are not able to remove it and they, so Intuit Quickbooks will at will, take money from your card. These little charges every month, random, ¬£1.92 here and another ¬£1.92 their, and so on.  It is fraud, and they continue to claim that my card is not stored on their platform.  Liars, blatant liars 2.  The stress of using Intuit Quickbooks for VAT Returns and such, is not worth your while.  Each time I have utilized these poorly executed services, I finish the session with a massive headache and questions over how in earth this company is still in business 3.  How can Intuit Quickbooks have a rating of just 2 stars a few months back, and now be rated at 4 stars?. Impossible, unless they have had all the honest reviews removed, because as we know, Trustpilot is as corrupt as most of the companies they back, because they are paid to remove honest reviews.  There is no way Intuit Quickbooks is a level 4 star rated company on Trustpilot. Impossible to have made up from 2 star to 4 star in a few months, considering the complaints that use to be on Trustpilot about ""Intuit Quickbooks"" 4.  Do not touch with a bargepole.  I am seeking a new provider to undertake our VAT returns and other company related stuff.  Intuit Quickbooks have major issues with their customer service, their billing, their hidden and stealth charges, which are to me illegal and how they are getting away with it currently, is astonishing. The UK and its services sector, is amongst some of the worst on the planet. I now have to go and stop my debit card, change the number, just to stop Intuit Quickbooks from continuing to randomly take money from it. They are liars, liars I tell you.  They will sit there and claim that they have not taken money, even though they have a confirmation email sent to me, stating they have taken all these little extras that I would never authorise. They have lied to me, probably lied to you too. 0/10 for Intuit Quickbooks, oh and Trustpilot, don't you dare remove my view of this company, because it does not fit with your little guidelines of ""how much can a customer pay us, to remain corrupt?"", hmm?.

"2025-08-29","5","F.L.","This app works fairly well, but there is one MAJOR improvement that needs to be (and could easily be) made. The OCR technology currently used for capturing receipts should also be utilized for capturing images of checks written. A user should be able to scan in a check after they write it, and have it automatically added to a list of outstanding checks. The list can update based off of a linked bank account as the checks clear. The total sum of the outstanding checks should be displayed in a widget on the dashboard near the bank accounts. This would greatly assist my check-dependent business in tracking how much money is left in the bank after outstanding checks are taken into account. A virtual check register, of sorts. This improvement could be made quite easily and quickly using existing features (the current OCR would work for checks, the custom reports can already be configured for outstanding checks, and only one widget would need to be added to the dashboard options). I believe this improvement would be quick and low-cost to implement, and would greatly add to the value of QuickBooks for businesses like mine. I‚Äôm hoping this improvement is made with all possible haste, as I will be left manually entering large numbers of checks until it is. Note: It would also be wise to ensure that the checks recorded via OCR automatically match with any exact corresponding expense transactions, or that the expense transactions automatically match to the checks.","App Store"

"2025-08-21","1","C.","The customer service representative that I interacted with was cordial and did their best to be helpful. However, there are just design flaws in the software: they built this for the US market and don't seem to care about making relevant alterations for other countries, despite being perfectly happy to sell the software there. Customer service acknowledged that the software is ""not aligned with the UK-specific format,"" but kept insisting that ""current design and functionality are working as intended within the system"". Uh, sure...but then your ""design functionality intentions"" are way off base. This isn't just me being pernickety about e.g., a postcode field being called 'zipcode' - that's annoying, but we get the idea. Some of this is fatal bugs, e.g., the incorrectly (US-like) formatted address on the generrated invoices would prevent payments from going through. I'm using this as a small UK business owner trying to navigate some complex financial stuff, and prepare myself for UK tax compliance. However, a lot of things that appear in the QuickBooks interface seem to be ported uncritically from the US version, in addition to the invoice address issue, in some places in settings the currency randomly appears as dollars, and the list of business types lists US legal entities and their corresponding IRS forms (e.g., sole proprietorship w/ form 1040 instead of sole trader). This does not inspire confidence that QuickBooks can help with my HMRC filings if they're recommending irrelevant US/IRS forms. I got QB on the recommendation of my accountant, and it has lots of functions that *should* be useful - but I will have to use something else for e.g., invoicing, until these issues are fixed.","Trustpilot"

Based on recent events, I can no longer recommend Quickbooks to anyone. The level of service and respect for your most dedicated partners has completely evaporated. Your company's retrospective implementation of a usage limit, coupled with an utter failure to communicate properly, has been a disaster. We received generic warnings with no client details, and your support team was unable to help us identify the affected accounts. This week, this incompetence culminated in the unexpected cancellation of eight of our clients' accounts, causing significant reputational damage and leaving us in a completely unprofessional situation. The proposed solution from your team was to reactivate these accounts, but only if we forfeited our long-standing discounted pricing. This is a punitive and insulting response that shows a complete disregard for customer loyalty. When combined with an unresponsive account manager, a history of poor customer service, and the constant failure to acknowledge our correct partner status, it is clear that Intuit no longer values its partners or their clients. We are now actively moving our entire client base to Xero, a competitor that we hope will offer a fraction of the respect and support we have lost with QuickBooks. If you are a firm considering a partnership with QuickBooks, be warned: your loyalty means nothing to this company.","Trustpilot"

When sending an estimate with a deposit you need to manually toggle and activate the methods of payment where it be through credit card or other options. In other words you can request a deposit but if you don‚Äôt toggle it the client has absolutely no way to pay the deposit. The new layout isn‚Äôt easier and as simple as the last one, the toggle icons don‚Äôt even match - to create an estimate the estimate tab is under ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù tab while the invoice is under another tab.

"2025-07-05","1","A.","Quick Books, it's been more like Slow Books for me. Growing your practice using this software is impossible. There are just too many issues, and most of it highly avoidable. Examples: - I am unable to log into the Support Services or Community. 'Authentication error' despite being logged into my Quick Books account. There is no way to overcome it. They don't tell you how to report this issue to them either. Due to this there is no way of reporting this to them online. I am left in the cold. Unable to ask for support or ask questions online. - First line support is very hit and miss, depends who you talk to. Sometimes they listen and try to help, other times they seem to just want to get you off the phone. - If your issues are escalated by first line support, and they often are due to a lack of ability, care and training, it could take days, weeks or months to reach a resolution. 1 seemingly simple issue I had took over 5 months resolve. 5 months!!! The person on the emails (2nd or 3rd line support) was refusing to organise a meeting with me or to telephone, was obnoxious, careless and completely ineffective. Eventually the issue was only resolved due to my persistence and the support of a 1st line support staff who stayed with me on the telephone and screen share to resolve the issue. For 5 months I had to tell a client I was unable to submit to HMRC and Companies House due to Quick Book's software not doing what it was supposed to do. Days of actual time and effort lost. - Today I am wanting to submit my practice accounts to HMRC and Companies House but it seems that Quick Books DOES NOT ALLOW this. Wow. Quick Books software does not allow accountants to submit their own books to HMRC or Companies House. How short sighted of them not to resolve this. I have searched all over the internet but there are no clear instructions of how to do this. One response on their support page was telling someone with the same issue to find another company, not Quick Books, to submit their accounts.

I spoke to someone in customer service tonight as Quickbooks is constantly crashing or just incredibly slow, and the only advice I got was it possible my server! Reallyü§î What rubbish!! Also the rules you create never seem to operate and you have to refresh bank transactions continually as the connection to your business bank account is continually interrupted. It‚Äôs getting worse from day to day so if you‚Äôre looking for an accounting package I would not recommend Quickbooks. It‚Äôs expensive and frankly not fit for purpose or worth the extortionate monthly subscription charge.","Trustpilot"

"2025-06-30","1","C.","QuickBooks for iPad is buggy. I recently created a new invoice and it somehow was given the same invoice number as the previous invoice (not using ‚Äúduplicate invoice‚Äù, but starting a new one). This created some issues with the client‚Äôs Accounts Payable. Also annoying is that client profile information cannot be edited in the app, so I have to sign in through a web browser. I also wish the QuickBooks kept a copy of sent emails, but it doesn‚Äôt, so I have to BCC myself to make sure I have record of the sent email. The most annoying bug is that, when using my Apple keyboard for iPad and composing in a text field (including trying to write the invoice email), QuickBooks does not respond to the ‚Äúreturn‚Äù key to start a new paragraph. I have to detach the keyboard and use the touchscreen version. I called support to report this bug and ended up talking in circles with the ‚Äúsupport‚Äù agent for much longer than I should have as she tried to direct me to download and install the DESKTOP version of the app on my iPad. I kept explaining that this would not work, and she kept trying to tell me that I had the wrong version of the app installed on my iPad and needed to download the desktop version. Absolutely useless customer service. The app is trash, and QuickBooks itself isn‚Äôt very good, but there aren‚Äôt many options out there, so‚Ä¶","App Store"

"2025-06-28","2","T.B.","I‚Äôve been using QuickBooks since around 2002, across multiple versions of Desktop and QuickBooks Online. I‚Äôve stayed loyal for over two decades and have never gone a full year without using this product. That said, QuickBooks today is incredibly frustrating. It‚Äôs slow, overly manual, and simply not efficient. So much time is spent just trying to complete basic tasks. Whether it‚Äôs creating a bill, entering a deposit, or reviewing transactions, the process is filled with unnecessary steps and delays. Mobile functionality is especially weak. Most core tasks are either unsupported or incomplete on the mobile app‚Äîyou constantly have to switch back to a desktop. Creating a bill? Not supported. Handling bank feeds? Limited. Deposits? Problematic. It feels like you‚Äôre only getting half a product unless you‚Äôre at your computer. With all the advancements in technology and AI in 2025, this level of inefficiency is no longer acceptable‚Äîespecially at QuickBooks‚Äô rising price point. I‚Äôve submitted feedback for years, and yet the same core issues remain. I don‚Äôt hate QuickBooks. It has strong potential. But after 20+ years of firsthand experience, I can confidently say the product needs serious attention. Intuit must focus on speed, usability, and making key functions fully available across all platforms.","App Store"

Well, I‚Äôm three days into into my ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù Soloprenuer subscription paired with this app and while most of my data was brought over from QBSE, not all of it was. I was promised an email when the migration process was over in about 24 hours total from the start, but that has yet to happen after three days. This new app seems to be struggling with my bank connections as they are very delayed or I receive emails telling me all my connections have expired and I have to refresh them. Never had that issue with QBSE. This new app doesn‚Äôt really seem like an upgrade and in fact, I have to hunt more to find things that were bundled together nicely in QBSE. I would give it one star but so far the mileage tracker has actually been working properly and as it should. This was a constant up and down battle with the QBSE app. But then also I used to always be able to upload PDF receipts on the QBSE app and while this new app does have that same option, it doesn‚Äôt work at all and I can only upload images.

I ended up with every bank account and credit card out of balance with duplicate entries in accounts. There is absolutely nothing intuitive about this app which is ironic for an ‚ÄúIntuit‚Äù product. As a decades long user of QB desktop, I have reluctantly learned QBO despite its crappiness. However, this app is truly garbage. Double entry?? No. It is not intuitive enough to do any double entry accounting. For $35/month, it is an epic rip off. It is near impossible to edit the chart of accounts or literally do anything with this app. It was a huge waste of time for me and I am a very skilled accountant/CPA with decades of experience. Do not waste your money on this garbage. Fortunately, I chose the $1/month 3 month trial. However, after 3 days I have already cancelled and switched to something else.

I wanted to speak to someone to help me set up everything and could not get in touch with a human being that spoke English at all. The accents were so strong. I asked them to please send me to someone who I can understand and I meant no offense by it. I just have trouble with strong accents, but this was barely English and lazy. I got tricked into signing up for $100 a month plan when all I wanted was a $20 month plan because they told me I could not use the laptop version without paying $100 a month. I immediately canceled and I am still getting upwards of three emails a day stating that I need to set up Bill pay and do all this other stuff. I have emailed several times saying to please quit harassing me through email and that I am not interested in the product due to the fact that nobody would help me, and nobody would speak to me in a clear English accent. This has been the worst business transaction of my life and it is now continuing to haunt me three weeks after cancellation and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it because everyone I contact is basically speaking Swahili and. I don‚Äôt know what else to do but leave a terrible review. I would avoid QuickBooks even if my life depended on it because after being in business for 20 years, this has been the worst customer service experience I‚Äôve ever had with any company trying to help me with business or any business in general for that matter. This is worse than trying to contact Google for support. QuickBooks if you would like to respond to this message and find out how terrible my experience was, I‚Äôm all for it but you need to stop sending me three emails a day considering I am not subscribed to your product and I have unsubscribed to all emails at least 35 times. If I continue to get harassed, I have no choice, but to file a civil suit due to the fact that you guys tried to scam me and to pay more money and now will not leave me alone through email.","App Store"

Here's how it works: 1. You turn off all business payment methods, and send the invoice. 2. The customer pays the full amount, plus a convenience tee, directly through our payment system using their bank account. You get paid the full amount of the invoice. The fee they pay doesn't affect your books. 3. Atter a 5-day processing time, we deposit the tull invoice amount to your account and automatically match the invoice, payment, and deposit in your books. There's nothing you have to do. You can turn this option off in Account & Settings. On Sales, open Invoice payments, and turn off Your customer pays the fee.

Then also different versions for web brewsers, then desktop. I get it you are trying to slice customers and make more money. But this is too far. Secondly, their customer support team is not trained properly. I was trying to ask a simple question: how can I add new categories to my bank transactions. It took the lady 15 minutes to understand my question, and another 30 minutes to find out that I need to upgrade my plan to get that feature. In this middle, I asked her to transfer me to someone who is more familiar with the topic, she still insisted to research herself. This leads to my last point: this subscribion is way over priced. At The end of my conversation with the customer support, they recommended I upgrade my plan to Quickbook Online Plus for $99/mo. Paying 100 for being able to add new categories?

"2024-11-02","1","J. N.","As a rideshare driver, I count on Self-employed Quickbooks for all my tax needs. It is unacceptable to pay $14.99 a month for a service that doesn't function any longer. We rely on your mileage tracker daily. Now I have to carry a notebook around and try to remember where I'm going. If this doesn't get resolved soon I am jumping ship to a new app that works. How hard is it to get this fixed?!?!?!","Google Play Store"

I've used it very little as it becomes so slow that even scrolling the invoices list takes minutes. Even the feedback feature fails because of a timeout. (Tested with high speed wifi too). Embarrassing","Google Play Store"
"2024-10-31","1","R. A.","The app has turned for the worst. Waste of money. Fix the mileage issues and the update issues. They raised the price again and still not working. They just keep increasing the fee but decreasing the app working. Can't get the mileage to work, can't do anything without 45 minutes of stress. What did they do? It was great 2 years ago and now I'm about ready to grab my data and stop paying for this worthless app. Now I keep trying to update and I click ok and it just keeps showing the same request","Google Play Store"

I have to turn off the auto lock setting on my phone and plug it into the charger to ensure it has enough time to load everything. The updates are always half baked. They will usually just mess up your settings. One update last year decided it would automatically choose the appropriate tax rate, but it would just make up a tax rate instead. It took hours to fix all the accounts, and I lost a few thousand dollars because of quickbooks tax rate update.","Google Play Store"

This is a paid service, yet it's clunky and uncomfortable to use. Free services, at the very least, have a decent search engine. No one should pay money for this garbage","Google Play Store"

It takes 15 to 30 seconds to upload/download every time you click anything. if you want to click, click, click you way through the accounting software this is not your solution. I haven't seen lagging like this since video games in the early 2000s. Do better quickbooks.","Google Play Store"

Each update is worse than the last. Mobile app has lots of bugs. Often need to stop and reopen the app. Won't allow me to input security features, says an unexpected error occurred. Love quickbooks otherwise. But the mobile app needs some work.","Google Play Store"
"2024-10-26","3","K. C.","Edit: Mileage tracking works again! Still frustrating that it was down for so long but I'll edit my review since they fixed it! Add this app to the list of apps that just break with recent updates. I have an android and mileage tracking used to work great but now it doesn't no matter how I've tried to fix it. I put in a ticket to customer service but never heard back. I pretty much only use and rely on the app for mileage tracking.","Google Play Store"
